  <h2>You're Halfway There Gryphons!</h2>
  <p>Welcome back from Reading Week! As we're now halfway through the semester, the library remains a great place to study and has many supports available to take you through the home stretch.</p>
  <p>A reminder that we continue to follow the <a href="https://www.lib.uoguelph.ca/using-library/reopening-library-services">Covid-19 protocols</a> outlined on our website, which include wearing medical-style masks, prohibiting food, allowing closed beverages, and encouraging social distancing where possible. </p>

  <h2>FAQ: What if I can’t find a resource in Omni?</h2>
  <p>We often get questions from students and researchers asking what to do if they can’t find a resource they need in Omni.</p>
  <p>If you can’t find what you’re looking for in Omni, try ordering it through RACER!</p>
  <p>RACER is an interlibrary loan service available to U of G students, staff, and faculty. Fill out a RACER form with your request, and you’ll typically get your book in 10 business days.</p>
