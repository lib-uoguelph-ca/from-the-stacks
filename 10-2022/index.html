  <h1>From the Stacks. U of G Library News. McLaughlin Library Newsletter</h1>
  <p>October 2022</p>  
  <h2>Offerings and reminders this library month</h2>
  <p>October is Library Month at the McLaughlin Library! The library is host to many exciting offerings in the coming weeks to help make your academic semester enjoyable and productive. Follow us on social media to learn more.</p>
  <p>With the second month of the fall academic semester underway, we would like to highlight the new book bins located near our new entrance that faces Johnston Green. We would also like to underscore the importance of returning only non-course reserve materials to these bins. Be sure to avoid late fines by returning course reserve materials to the white course reserve return shelf adjacent to the Course Reserves collection to automatically discharge the items from your account. Additional information on course reserves is included further in the newsletter. </p>
  <p>While we recognize this is a busy time of year for all, we hope you find some time to unwind and recharge over the Fall Break from October 8-11. The library will be closed October 8-10 and will be open for reduced hours on October 11 from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. As always, we are eager to help you realize your academic goals and welcome questions anytime. We wish you all the best for October.</p>
