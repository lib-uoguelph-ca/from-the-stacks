  <h2>Black History Month at the Library</h2>
  <p>To celebrate Black History Month, we're highlighting two displays. The first is a new digital collection curated by the Guelph Black Students Association and the University of Guelph's Cultural Diversity team in Student Experience, <a href="https://maestro.uoguelph.ca/trk/click?ref=z12igfsq5w_0-43e5x3206f8x0389&">titled Black History Month 2024: 360°; Health and Wellness</a>. The collection focuses on a holistic approach to health and wellness and showcases works by historically underrepresented Black voices to foster inclusivity, education, empowerment, and community building.</p>
  <p>And, if you're in the library, check out the Black History Month Gryph Reads display, and browse a variety of works by Black authors</p>
