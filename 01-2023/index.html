  <h2>Library Team Spotlight: Information Literacy</h2>
  <p>It's the start of a new semester and we're delighted to welcome students, faculty, and staff back from the holidays! We hope everyone enjoyed a well-deserved break.</p>
  <p>The beginning of a new semester presents a great opportunity for students to build a solid foundation of essential skills to bolster their success throughout the semester and beyond. One such skill is effective researching. Conducting research can often be challenging but the library's Information Literacy (IL) team can help.</p>
  <p>From workshops, to assistance with finding articles or books for a specific project, the IL team can help to simplify the complexities of the researching process. The IL team has also compiled an extensive range of videos, guides, and handouts on an array of topics. Students can access these materials to learn how to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Write an essay</li>
    <li>Find data and statistics</li>
    <li>Create a digital assignment</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Further, the IL team offers research support services for faculty and instructors, such as in-class instruction sessions available in synchronous and asynchronous formats. A librarian will work with the course instructor to plan the most effective session to support their particular course.</p>
  <p>Have a joyful January and do not forget to connect with the IL team before embarking on your next research project!</p>
