  <h1>From the Stacks. U of G Library News. McLaughlin Library Newsletter</h1>
  <p>September 2022</p>  
  <h2>Welcome to a New Semester</h2>
  <p>Welcome to campus and a new semester! The library has been quiet this summer and we're looking forward to the hustle and bustle of the fall semester. Facing Johnston Green, the new entrance is bigger, better, and ready to welcome you. Please note the old entrance off Winegard Walk is no longer accessible. When visiting the library, food and beverages are once again allowed and masking is optional, but recommended in high-density spaces. We are designating the north end of the 5th floor as a mask-required area for those that need it. You may also notice we've switched to a new newsletter platform. As a result, when you update your email preferences or unsubscribe you will be asked to create a password. If you have any questions or concerns let us know!</p>
