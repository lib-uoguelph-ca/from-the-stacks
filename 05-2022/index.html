  <h1>From the Stacks. U of G Library News. McLaughlin Library Newsletter</h1>
  <p>May 2022</p>  
  <h2>Summer is around the corner!</h2>
  <p>We hope you’re relaxing and recharging between semesters, Gryphons! Summer semester is just around the corner, and whether you’re taking a full course load, doing an online course while working, or just looking to use library resources, we’re here for you.</p>
  <p>Note that the library Starbucks is closed during the summer, so if you need to refuel while working at the library you can stop by the UC, the Bullring, or the Second Cup in the Summerlee Science Complex. <a href="https://hospitality.uoguelph.ca/hours-menus/current-hours-operation">See hospitality services summer schedule.</a></p>

  <h2>Celebrate Asian Heritage Month</h2>
  <p>May is Asian Heritage Month, and in honour the library has curated a new online collection Celebrating Asian Heritage Month that highlights Asian cultures, heritage, and identities.</p>
  <p>One item in the collection, Dining with Dragons, is authored by a Malaysian food writer and chef who has a special connection to Guelph, Carol Selva Raja. After Carol moved to Canada for her husband to attend U of G, she became the first to introduce Malaysian cooking to Guelph and soon became a household name for her cooking show Citarasa.</p>
