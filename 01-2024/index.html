        <p>Travel the World, a new Gryph Reads display, is up on the first floor of the library. Throughout January, you can travel the world (and to other worlds) through stories. Whether you’re looking for a new piece of fiction, or a real-life memoire, this display will have something for you.

        <p>The cancellation of the library’s Springer Journals package took effect on January 1, 2024. This means for most Springer journal titles, we will no longer receive new issues published, from 2024 onward.
