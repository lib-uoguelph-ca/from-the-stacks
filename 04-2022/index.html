  <h2>Good luck on your exams!</h2>
  <p>The end of the semester is now in sight as we officially enter exam season, and we’re here to help you reach the finish line and achieve&nbsp;your goals. Whether you'd like advice on a research paper, suggestions of effective study strategies, or tips on how to balance your studies and your wellness, we have resources for you.</p>
  <p>A reminder that we&nbsp;require medical-style masks at all times in the library and our vaccination policy remains in effect&nbsp;until the end of term. We appreciate your continued cooperation. If you prefer studying with friends, good news – we have lifted our physical distancing requirements! Group study rooms can once again be booked according to their capacity limits.</p>
