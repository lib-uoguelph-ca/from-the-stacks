  <h2>Exam Stress Busters at the Library</h2>
  <p>Exams are coming up, and as such, so are exam stress busters! If you're visiting the library to study, we encourage you to take a break and enjoy some of the activities we've prepared for you. Post a positive message for your peers on the Positive Wall, drop a worry in the Worry Box, or pick up an Activity Book or page to help you take a break from studying. Balance matters! Learn more about the events happening at the library for <a href="https://www.lib.uoguelph.ca/news/exam-stress-busters-library-semester/">Exam Stress Busters</a>, as well as links to helpful studying resources.</p>

  <h2>Calling All Foodies - New Exhibit on Now!</h2>
  <p>Interested in learning more about the Canadian food scene and how it's changed overtime? If so, we encourage you to check out Cooking Up History: 30 Years of the Culinary Historians of Canada (CHC), the exhibit that just launched in our Archival & Special Collections Exhibit Room. This exhibit not only commemorates the 30th anniversary of the CHC—it also highlights the inductees of Taste Canada's Hall of Fame. Learn more about this <a href="https://www.lib.uoguelph.ca/news/cooking-history-exhibition-full-history-future-ready-opportunities/">student-curated exhibit</a> and how you can browse it over the next number of months.</p>
