  <h2>Library Staff Spotlight: Kimm Khagram</h2>
  <p>As students begin to prepare for December exams, we would like to highlight the work of Kimm Khagram, learning specialist at the library. Since 2017, Kimm has helped students reach their academic goals and feel better prepared for exams through his management and co-supervision of SLGs (Supported Learning Groups).</p>
  <p>SLGs are group study sessions offered by the library for challenging undergraduate courses which span a variety of disciplines. These weekly sessions are facilitated by upper year students who received a high grade in the course. SLG leaders are trained to help students learn together and develop effective learning strategies (based on education research) while reviewing course content.</p>
  <p>Students can attend SLG sessions throughout the semester, though Kimm notes that attendance often peaks just before a major test or exam. SLG leaders anticipate this increased demand and plan active and collaborative study for as many as 150 students at a time, either online or in person. Rather than simulating exam conditions, SLG review sessions encourage students to work together to actively recall concepts from memory, identify gaps and mistakes, and share their strategies on how to study and take the test.</p>
  <p>Be sure to visit the library’s website for up-to-date information on SLG sessions.</p>

  <h2>Exam Study Tips</h2>
  <p>The approach of exams can often incite feelings of uncertainty among students. The library is an essential resource to help students navigate this challenging time and succeed with their exams by developing effective study habits.</p>
  <p>One key aspect of studying effectively involves practicing active learning. An essential component of active learning is developing active study strategies to help you to engage with and retain the content you are seeking to learn. Some examples of active study strategies include teaching the material to another person, verbalizing information rather than silently reading it, or creating your own slides to demonstrate your comprehension of a specific course concept.</p>
  <p>We invite students to explore the library’s abundance of resources and guidance on mastering the art of studying to foster confidence and minimize stress. Follow along on our social media channels in the coming weeks for updates on exciting activities the library is planning to alleviate exam stress.</p>
