  <h1>From the Stacks. U of G Library News. McLaughlin Library Newsletter</h1>
  <p>June 2022</p>  
  <h2>Congrats Grads!</h2>
  <p>Summer semester is in full swing, but for some Gryphons it's time to don a cap and gown and celebrate their achievements. To the graduating class of 2022: Congratulations from all of us at the library. We're still here for you after you graduate. Scroll down for information about services you can access as an alum. </p>
  <p>Things are a bit quieter during the summer at the library, so we're going to take a brief newsletter hiatus for July and August. For this edition, we're excited to share with you exhibitions and collections that are launching in June! </p>

  <h2>Journey Together With Us For Indigenous History Month</h2>
  <p>In honour of National Indigenous History Month in June, we've partnered with Indigenous Initiatives and the Indigenous Student Centre to expand the library's online collection of works by First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis people.</p>
  <p>The new sub-collection "Journeying Together: Indigenous History Month 2022" seeks to provide members of the U of G community a growing repository of resources to help support action and reconciliation with all Indigenous peoples.</p>

  <h2>Showcasing Positive LGBTQIA+ Representation for Pride</h2>
  <p>To help U of G students find examples of positive representation in books and movies, we've partnered with the Sexuality and Gender Diversity Office to bring you the "Pride 2022: Representation Matters" collection.</p>
  <p>Items in this collection are pulled from the <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/edit/gBM-l-GiYwQSb1XP9jiyHLe0/">LGBTQ2IA+ Representation Matters Masterdoc</a>, compiled by Tess, a peer helper in the Sexuality and Gender Diversity Office.</p>
