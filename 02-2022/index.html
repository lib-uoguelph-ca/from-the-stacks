  <h2>Moving to In-Person Learning Guide</h2>
  <p>It's been great to see so many of you on campus and back in the library this semester! We hope that you've had a smooth transition to on-campus learning, but we know that adjusting to a new routine can be a challenge. To help, we've created a Moving to In-Person Learning Guide with our top tips on using your down time, attending lectures in person, and writing in-person exams.</p>
